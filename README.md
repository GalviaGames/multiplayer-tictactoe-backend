# Multiplayer TicTacToe backend made with Defold and Nakama

Minor modifications from the original [Nakama + Defold tutorial](https://defold.com/2021/03/02/Creating-online-games-using-Nakama-and-Defold/), in the code we just got rid of the rematch logic to simplify the implementation. On the infra side, we created a single independent Docker image to make deploying more convenient.

Currently deployed in Railway.app.
